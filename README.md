# Population Data Visualization

This repository contains Python scripts that visualize population data using **matplotlib** and **numpy**. Two types of charts are included:

1. **Histogram**: Shows the distribution of ages in a population.
2. **Bar Chart**: Shows the distribution of gender counts in a population.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and the following libraries installed:

- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy

Visualizations
1. Age Distribution Histogram
This chart shows the distribution of randomly generated ages between 18 and 65.

X-axis: Age groups
Y-axis: Frequency of each age group
2. Gender Distribution Bar Chart
This chart displays the counts of different genders in a population.

X-axis: Gender categories (Male, Female, Non-Binary, Other)
Y-axis: Number of individuals in each gender category
